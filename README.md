# Ad-hoc-Insights-in-Consumer-Goods-Domain


### Introduction
This project was undertaken as part of the Codebasics Data Analyst Bootcamp for Atliq Hardwares, a leading computer hardware producer in India and abroad. The aim was to provide quick and insightful data-driven decisions through a series of ad-hoc SQL queries. The target audience for the insights is the top-level management.

### SQL Challenge - Insightful Queries
To address the 6 ad-hoc requests, we employed advanced SQL concepts including Joins, Subqueries, CTEs, and Window functions, and automated tasks using Stored Procedures and Views. Domain knowledge on fiscal year, quarters, and profit & loss statements was integrated into the analysis.
